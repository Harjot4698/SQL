        <h2>Error 1064: SQL Syntax Error</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong>
          Error 1064 occurs when there's a syntax mistake in the SQL query, such as missing or misplaced keywords,
          quotation marks, or parentheses.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong>
          Let's say you have a table named 'employees' with columns 'id' and 'name', and you want to select all records
          with names starting with 'John':
        </p>
        <code>
          SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = 'John%';
        </code>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong>
          The correct query should use the 'LIKE' keyword to specify a pattern match for the 'name' column:
        </p>
        <code>
          SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'John%';
        </code>
      </section>

      <section id="error1451">
        <h2>Error 1451: Cannot delete or update a parent row</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong>
          Error 1451 occurs when trying to delete or update a row in a table with a foreign key constraint, and the action
          would violate the referential integrity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong>
          Let's say you have two tables, 'orders' and 'order_details'. The 'order_details' table has a foreign key
          'order_id' referencing the 'id' column in the 'orders' table. If you try to delete an 'orders' row that has
          corresponding 'order_details' rows, you'll encounter this error.
        </p>
        <code>
          DELETE FROM orders WHERE id = 1;
        </code>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong>
          To resolve this error, either delete the corresponding rows in the 'order_details' table first, or update the
          foreign key value in the 'order_details' table to reference a valid 'order_id' in the 'orders' table.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="error1054">
        <h2>Error 1054: Unknown Column</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong>
          Error 1054 occurs when the specified column name in the SQL query does not exist in the referenced table.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong>
          Let's say you have a table named 'employees' with columns 'id' and 'name', and you want to select the 'age' column
          (which doesn't exist):
        </p>
        <code>
          SELECT age FROM employees;
        </code>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong>
          Check the column name spelling and ensure that it exists in the 'employees' table.
        </p>
      </section>
  
      <section id="error1005">
        <h2>Error 1005: Can't create table</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong>
          Error 1005 occurs when there is an issue creating a table due to a foreign key constraint error or a syntax
          mistake in the SQL statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong>
          Let's say you have two tables, 'orders' and 'order_details'. When trying to create a foreign key constraint in
          the 'order_details' table that references the 'id' column in the 'orders' table, you encounter this error if the
          data types or indexes of the columns don't match.
        </p>
        <code>
          CREATE TABLE order_details (
            order_id INT,
            -- other columns...
            FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id)
          );
        </code>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong>
          Ensure that the data types and indexes of the columns used in the foreign key constraint match the referenced
          columns in the other table. Also, make sure that the referenced table exists.
        </p>
      </section>
  
      <section id="error1062">
        <h2>Error 1062: Duplicate entry</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong>
          Error 1062 occurs when trying to insert a duplicate entry into a column with a unique constraint, such as a
          primary key or a unique index.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong>
          Let's say you have a table named 'users' with a column 'email' defined as unique, and you try to insert a new
          user with an email that already exists in the table:
        </p>
        <code>
          INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');
        </code>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong>
          Before inserting data, check if the value you are inserting already exists in the column with the unique
          constraint. You can use an 'IF NOT EXISTS' clause or check for duplicates before inserting.
        </p>
      </section>
  
      <section id="error1146">
        <h2>Error 1146: Table doesn't exist</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong>
          Error 1146 occurs when trying to access or reference a table that does not exist in the database.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong>
          Let's say you want to perform a select query on a table named 'products', but the table 'products' does not exist
          in the database:
        </p>
        <code>
          SELECT * FROM products;
        </code>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong>
          Double-check the table name spelling and ensure that the table 'products' exists in the database before running
          the query.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="error1215">
        <h2>Error 1215: Cannot add foreign key constraint</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong>
          Error 1215 occurs when trying to add a foreign key constraint to a table, but there is a mismatch between the
          data types or index in the referenced table or the referenced table itself does not exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong>
          Let's say you have two tables, 'orders' and 'customers'. When trying to add a foreign key constraint to the
          'orders' table that references the 'id' column in the 'customers' table, you encounter this error if the data
          types or indexes of the columns don't match.
        </p>
        <code>
          ALTER TABLE orders
          ADD FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id);
        </code>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong>
          Ensure that the data types and indexes of the columns used in the foreign key constraint match the referenced
          columns in the other table. Also, make sure that the referenced table ('customers') exists in the database.
        </p>
      </section>
  
      <section id="error1265">
        <h2>Error 1265: Data truncated</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong>
          Error 1265 occurs when trying to insert or update data into a column, but the value being inserted is too large
          for the column's data type, resulting in data truncation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong>
          Let's say you have a column 'description' in a table with a data type of VARCHAR(50), and you try to insert a
          value longer than 50 characters into the column:
        </p>
        <code>
          INSERT INTO products (name, description) VALUES ('Product 1', 'This is a very long description that exceeds the
          50-character limit.');
        </code>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong>
          Ensure that the data being inserted or updated fits within the column's defined data type and length. You can
          either truncate the data before inserting or modify the column's data type to accommodate longer values.
        </p>
      </section>
  
      <section id="error2006">
        <h2>Error 2006: MySQL server has gone away</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong>
          Error 2006 occurs when the MySQL server drops the connection due to inactivity or timeout settings. This can
          happen if a long-running query or operation takes too much time to complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong>
          This error can occur when executing a large query that takes a long time to process or when trying to import a
          large dataset that causes the connection to time out.
        </p>
        <code>
          -- Large, time-consuming query
          SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE ...;
  
          -- Importing a large dataset
          LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'data.csv' INTO TABLE my_table;
        </code>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong>
          To resolve this error, you can try the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Optimize the query or operation to run more efficiently.</li>
            <li>Increase the timeout settings on the MySQL server.</li>
            <li>Break down large operations into smaller batches if possible.</li>
            <li>Check your internet connection and network stability.</li>

      <section id="error1452">
        <h2>Error 1452: Cannot add or update a child row</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong>
          Error 1452 occurs when trying to insert or update a row with a foreign key constraint, and the referenced parent
          row does not exist in the parent table.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong>
          Let's say you have two tables, 'orders' and 'customers'. The 'orders' table has a foreign key 'customer_id'
          referencing the 'id' column in the 'customers' table. If you try to insert an 'order' with a 'customer_id' that
          does not exist in the 'customers' table, you will encounter this error.
        </p>
        <code>
          INSERT INTO orders (order_id, customer_id, total_amount)
          VALUES (1, 1001, 50.00);
        </code>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong>
          Ensure that the 'customer_id' value being inserted or updated in the 'orders' table corresponds to a valid
          'id' in the 'customers' table. Check for data integrity and validate foreign key values before performing
          insert or update operations.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="error1065">
        <h2>Error 1065: Query was empty</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong>
          Error 1065 occurs when an SQL query is executed with no actual content. This happens when the query is empty or
          contains only whitespace characters.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong>
          An empty query that triggers this error:
        </p>
        <code>
          ;
        </code>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong>
          Ensure that your SQL query has valid content and is not empty. Double-check the query statement for any
          inadvertent semicolons or whitespace characters.
        </p>

        <h2>Error 1264: Out of range value for column</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong>
          Error 1264 occurs when you attempt to insert a value that is outside the acceptable range for a specific column's
          data type.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong>
          Let's say you have a column 'age' defined as INT, which only allows values from -2147483648 to 2147483647. If you
          try to insert a value outside this range, you will encounter this error.
        </p>
        <code>
          INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('John Doe', 5000000000);
        </code>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong>

          Error 1364 occurs when trying to insert a new row into a table with a column that has no default value defined,
          and you do not provide a value for that column in the INSERT statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong>
          Let's say you have a table 'employees' with a column 'date_of_joining' that has no default value defined. If you
          try to insert a new employee without specifying the 'date_of_joining', you will encounter this error.
        </p>
        <code>
          INSERT INTO employees (name, department) VALUES ('Jane Smith', 'Sales');
        </code>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong>
          Provide a value for the column that has no default value during the INSERT operation, or set a default value for
          the column in the table's schema to avoid this error.

        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong>
          Error 1305 occurs when trying to call a non-existent or undefined function in an SQL query.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong>
          Let's say you try to use the function 'MY_CUSTOM_FUNCTION' in a query, but the function is not defined in the
          database:
        </p>
        <code>
          SELECT id, name, MY_CUSTOM_FUNCTION(price) AS discounted_price FROM products;
        </code>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong>
          Ensure that the function 'MY_CUSTOM_FUNCTION' is defined in the database before using it in your queries.

        <h2>Error 2014: Commands out of sync</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong>
          Error 2014 occurs when trying to execute another query before processing the results of the previous query.
          This usually happens when using client libraries or programming interfaces that do not handle multiple
          queries correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong>
          When using a programming interface to execute multiple queries without fetching the results or using stored
          procedures, you may encounter this error.
        </p>
        <code>
          SELECT * FROM products; // Query 1
          INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, total_amount) VALUES (1001, 50.00); // Query 2
        </code>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong>
          To avoid this error, make sure to fetch and process the results of one query before executing another. If using
          client libraries or programming interfaces, ensure that they handle multiple queries appropriately.
